   Release Notes <https://github.com/realm/realm-js/releases>

The {+service+} Web SDK enables browser-based applications to access
data stored in {+atlas+} and interact with {+backend+} services like
Functions and authentication. The Web SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript applications.

The Web SDK does not support creating a local database or using :ref:`sync <sync>`. 
Instead, web apps built with {+service-short+} use :ref:`GraphQL <graphql-api>` 
or the :manual:`Query API </web-mongodb-data-access>` to query data stored in 
{+atlas-short+}.

.. note::

   There are SDKs built for :ref:`React Native <react-native-intro>`
   and :ref:`Node.js <node-intro>` which should be used when creating
   apps in these environments. Alternatively, you 
   can use the Web SDK for React Native or Node.js apps, but additional 
   steps must be taken. For further instruction, visit the :ref:`Web SDK 
   installation page <web-install>`.
